# Nasonia segmentation stains

This is the gene expression dataset associated with Taylor and Dearden, 2022 (Development). https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.199632
 
Images are all maximum intensity projections, stained using hybridization chain reaction v3.0, (Choi et al. 2018), imaged under a FV3000 microscope. Channels are in the order described in the *folder header*, not the file name (for a small number of stains, multiple stains were imaged in the same imaging session so the filename is the same for each image. We are absolutely confident that the genes names assigned are correct because we were very careful when imaging these, and because the genes have visually distinctive expression patterns). 

Images are staged by the number of eve or wg stripes, or by other genes when necessary (ie if wg/eve were not included in the stain).
